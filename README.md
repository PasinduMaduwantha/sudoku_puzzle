Sudoku Puzzle Generator & Solver
Sudoku is a very popular mathematical puzzle. In general, the 9-by-9 cell grid is filled with
numbers from 1 to 9 in a random pattern. However, a number appears in a row or a column
only once. Further, the 9-by-9 grid is subdivided into nine 3-by-3 cell grids. A number appears
only once within the 3-by-3 cell grid as well
Here, first, generate a Sudoku puzzle with randomly distributed numbers. The number
of numbers missing in a row or a column can be between 2 to 4. Hint: A Sudoku puzzle can be generated with all the numbers and then randomly remove the
numbers according to the hardness of the puzzle. Secondly, an algorithm should be developed to solve the Sudoku puzzle generated in the first
step according to the rules. If the algorithm places a wrong number on a missing cell, it should be
indicated. Users can decide to start over the solving process or remove the wrong number to start
the solving process from the previous step. Users can select how many cells are blank/with missing values in a row or column at the
beginning of the program. Then the puzzle is presented to the user. Once the user issues the
command to solve the puzzle, the algorithm will automatically fill the missing cells step by step, and each step will be displayed to the user while indicating the newly filled c
